# prime-numbers-with-python
This is a simple python prime number generator for integers <= 10**6. The file uses lists, list comprehension, a 'while' loop, and the Seive of Eratothenses. There are much faster prime number generators, but this one has an easily followed logic and uses python with no additional packages.
