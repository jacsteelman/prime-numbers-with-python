# prime-numbers-with-python
File prime.py contains two python functions:

Function prime_list(...) is a simple python prime number generator for integers <= 10**6. The file uses lists, list comprehension, a 'while' loop, and the Seive of Eratosthenes. There are much faster prime number generators, but this one has an easily followed logic and uses python with no additional packages.  

Function prime_np(...) is much faster and uses Numpy and bools. There are faster prime number generators, but this function is relatively easy to understand. Remember to import Numpy as:

import numpy as np
